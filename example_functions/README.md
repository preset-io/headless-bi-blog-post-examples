# Example functions

Here you can find examples on how to leverage Jinja templating with the CLI to perform dynamic imports.

# How to use them
Each example should include the full importable content (all depdencies included) so that you can just trigger an import pointing to the example folder. 
Some examples might have additional dependencies that must be installed, so make sure to check the example's `README` file.
